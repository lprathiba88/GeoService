# GeoService
This repository is used to calculate the distance between two sets of latitudes and longitudes.
The distance calculated is stored and added cumulatively to find the total distance travelled.
One can also find the specific area or location in a town or city given the latitude and longitude.
A simple test class is included to test these features.
